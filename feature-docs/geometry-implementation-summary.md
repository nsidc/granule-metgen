# Geometry Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Functional Geometry Resolution System

We successfully implemented a functional programming approach to geometry resolution that:

- **Created two new modules**:
  - `src/nsidc/metgen/geometry_resolver.py` - Determines which geometry source to use based on rules
  - `src/nsidc/metgen/geometry_extractor.py` - Extracts and transforms geometry from various sources

- **Integrated with the processing pipeline**:
  - Updated `read_geometry()` in metgen.py to use the geometry resolver
  - Updated `write_geometry()` in metgen.py to extract and transform geometry
  - Modified `create_ummg()` to use pre-processed geometry when available

- **Added comprehensive tests**:
  - `tests/test_geometry_resolver.py` - 19 tests covering all geometry rules
  - `tests/test_geometry_extractor.py` - 10 tests covering transformations

### 2. Key Features Implemented

1. **Rule-based geometry source selection** following the README specification
2. **Immutable data structures** (GeometryContext, GeometryDecision)
3. **Pure functions** for each geometry rule
4. **Clear error messages** for invalid geometry combinations
5. **Type-safe enums** for geometry sources and types
6. **Geometry transformation** functions for UMM-G output

### 3. Testing Results

- ✅ All 185 tests pass
- ✅ Code passes linting (ruff check)
- ✅ Code is properly formatted (ruff format)
- ✅ New geometry tests provide comprehensive coverage

## Current State

The implementation is in a **transitional state** where:

1. The new geometry pipeline is implemented and integrated
2. Old utility functions are still used internally by the new modules
3. A fallback mechanism exists in `create_ummg()` for backward compatibility
4. All tests pass, ensuring no regression

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear separation of concerns** between geometry resolution and extraction
2. **Functional programming approach** makes the code more maintainable and testable
3. **Direct mapping** to the geometry rules table in the README
4. **Extensible design** allows easy addition of new rules or sources
5. **Better error handling** with specific messages for each invalid case

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real data** to ensure the pipeline works end-to-end
2. **Implement point counting** for spatial files (currently stubbed)
3. **Move utility function implementations** into the geometry modules
4. **Remove the fallback** in create_ummg() once fully tested
5. **Add integration tests** for the complete geometry pipeline

## Code Quality

- All new code follows project conventions
- Type hints are used throughout
- Comprehensive docstrings explain each function
- Code is formatted according to project standards
- No linting errors or warnings

## Documentation Created

1. `feature-docs/geometry-resolution-implementation.md` - Detailed implementation guide
2. `feature-docs/geometry-refactoring-todo.md` - Plan for completing the refactoring
3. `feature-docs/geometry-implementation-summary.md` - This summary

The implementation provides a solid foundation for geometry handling that can be incrementally improved while maintaining backward compatibility.
