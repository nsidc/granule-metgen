# Updates to granule-metgen Since March 31, 2025

## Overview
Since your last commit on March 31, 2025, there have been significant enhancements to the metadata generation capabilities, particularly around spatial data handling, temporal flexibility, and additional attribute support. The project has progressed from version 1.4.0 through 1.5.0 to the current 1.6.1rc1.

## Major Features and Enhancements

### 1. Additional Attributes Support (Issues #186, #163, #200)
- **New Feature**: Added support for parsing `AdditionalAttributes` from `.premet` files and including them in UMM-G output
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created new template `ummg_additional_attributes_template.txt`
  - Added `populate_additional_attributes()` function to process attributes
  - Attributes are now parsed from premet files and properly formatted in the UMM-G JSON
- **Bug Fix (v1.6.1)**: Fixed issue where additional attributes were incorrectly required - now properly optional with null checks

### 2. Enhanced Spatial Data Handling (Issues #158, #161)

#### Spatial Polygon Processing (Issue #158)
- **Enhancement**: Improved `.spo` file processing for Cumulus compliance
- **Key Changes**:
  - Polygons are now automatically closed if not already closed
  - Point order is reversed to create counter-clockwise definitions (Cumulus requirement)
  - Added `parse_spo()` and `closed_polygon()` utility functions
  - Added comprehensive test coverage with `closed.spo` and `open.spo` fixtures

#### Spatial File Support (Issue #161)
- **New Feature**: Added support for `.spatial` files as an additional spatial data source
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `spatial_filename` parameter to Granule objects
  - Modified file grouping logic to include spatial files
  - Spatial files are now processed alongside premet files in the pipeline

### 3. Flexible Time Handling (Issue #160)
- **Enhancement**: Improved temporal extent parsing from `.premet` files
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Support for multiple key aliases (e.g., `RangeBeginningDate` or `Begin_date`)
  - Can now handle single time points in addition to time ranges
  - More flexible whitespace handling in premet parsing
  - Added `find_key_aliases()` utility function for key name resolution

### 4. Code Organization and Quality Improvements
- **Refactoring**: 
  - Moved `netcdf_reader.py` to the `readers` module for better organization
  - Renamed all template files from `.json` to `.txt` extension
  - Added constants for magic strings (e.g., `UMMG_ADDITIONAL_ATTRIBUTES`)
- **Error Handling**: Pipeline now properly skips remaining operations if a previous step fails
- **Logging**: Improved logging throughout, moved collection metadata harvest messages from stdout to log

### 5. CMR Integration Enhancement
- **New Feature**: Now extracts and stores `GranuleSpatialRepresentation` from CMR collection metadata
- **Impact**: Enables more accurate spatial representation in generated UMM-G files

## Bug Fixes
1. **CSV Reader**: Fixed bug preventing parsing of UTM zones (Issue #108)
2. **Additional Attributes**: Fixed requirement issue making them mandatory when they should be optional
3. **Pipeline Processing**: Fixed issue where failed operations didn't prevent subsequent steps

## Documentation Updates
- Multiple README updates to reflect new features and usage
- Updated Read the Docs configuration
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all new features

## Version Progression
- 1.4.0 → 1.5.0: Major features (spatial files, time handling, additional attributes)
- 1.5.0 → 1.6.0: Additional attributes template integration
- 1.6.0 → 1.6.1: Bug fix for optional additional attributes

## Testing
All new features include comprehensive test coverage:
- Spatial polygon closing and ordering tests
- Additional attributes parsing tests
- Flexible time parsing tests
- Integration tests for new file types

## Impact Summary
These updates significantly enhance the tool's flexibility and robustness:
- Better support for diverse input formats and metadata requirements
- Improved compliance with Cumulus requirements
- More reliable error handling and processing
- Enhanced extensibility for future data format support
